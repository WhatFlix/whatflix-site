Here you go â€” a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys your site to GitHub Pages every time you push to the main branch:


---

ðŸ“„ .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: .

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2


---

ðŸ“¥ How to set it up:

1. Go to your GitHub repo.


2. In the root, create a folder: .github/workflows


3. Inside that folder, create a new file called: deploy.yml


4. Paste the code above into that file and commit it.


5. Make sure:

Your default branch is main

GitHub Pages is set to deploy from GitHub Actions





---

ðŸŸ¢ After this:

Any push to main = auto-deployment to GitHub Pages (https://whatflix.github.io/whatflix-site/) or via your custom domain (WhatFlix.net) if set up.

Let me know once itâ€™s in, and I can test it with a minor update to confirm itâ€™s all working smoothly.
